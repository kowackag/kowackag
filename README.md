I am Ma≈Çgorzata, retiring soldier of Polish Armed Forces and **Front-end Developer**. 
I'm looking for a dream job that will enable me to create amazing apps and webs that will meet clients requirements, as well as to help me develop my skills that will benefit in the further work.

What I am currently devoting to?

- I'm delving into Next.js, React, TypeScript and GraphQl.

What else makes me fun?

- When I start doing puzzles It is hard to keep me from doing it.
- I love the feeling after a long-distance run...even if I run out of steam. 
- I enjoy the flavour of coffee especially having a break during a trekking trip.
- It is hard to imagine the life without a mango and strawberries üå±

I am an appropriate person if you are looking for the employee **who may have an impact on your business development**, because she:

- is open-minded,
- has a high sense of responsibility,
- is open to constructive criticism and is able to draw conclusions from it,
- is self-motivated and is willing to continuously enhance her competence,
- she has no problem with finding yourself in a new work environment and has positive attitude to people.
