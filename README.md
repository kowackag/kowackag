I am Ma≈Çgorzata - retiring soldier of Polish Armed Forces and Front-end enthusiast.

I have found myself especially in creating front-end web applications however the building responsive websides also makes me fun.

What I am currently devoting to?

- I'm finishing Individual Front-end Development Course with an experienced mentor Mateusz Bogolubow - [devmentor.pl](devmentor.pl).
- I'm delving into React, Redux and JavaScript.
- I'm looking for a job to create amazing apps and webs, as well as to develop my skills that will benefit in the further work .

What else makes me fun?

- When I start doing puzzles It is hard to keep me from doing it.
- I love the feeling after a long-distance run...even if I run out of steam. 
- I enjoy the flavour of coffee especially having a break during a trekking trip.
- It is hard to imagine the life without a mango and strawberries üå±

I am an appropriate person if you are looking for the employee who:

- has a high sense of responsibility,
- is open to constructive criticism and is able to draw conclusions from it,
- is self-motivated and is willing to continuously enhance her competence,
- has no problem with finding yourself in a new work environment and has positive attitude to people.
